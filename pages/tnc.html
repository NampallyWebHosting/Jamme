            <h5>15. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h5>
            <p>These Terms of Use and your use of the Application are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of United Kingdom, without regard to its conflict of law principles   If the parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the Central Arbitration Committee (“CAC”) and, where appropriate, the CAC’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“CAC Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the CAC web site https://www.gov.uk/. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the CAC Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the CAC Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable CAC rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in a location that mutually agreed by both parties and United Kingdom law shall apply. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator   'The Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defences of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non convenient with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the United Kingdom courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use. Instead, this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom, without regard to its conflict of law principles.'   This revision ensures that the jurisdiction and governing laws are explicitly stated as being in the United Kingdom, which is essential for legal clarity and enforceability of the terms within the UK legal framework. In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Application be commenced more than 2 years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court   The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons</p>
            <h5>16. Class Action Waiver</h5>
            <p>Any legal dispute, arbitration, or litigation under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted</p>
            <p>THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER</p>
            <p>Further, unless both you and Squad agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding</p>
            <h5>17. Sever-ability</h5>
            <p>If any part of these Terms are determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms shall continue in effect</p>
            <h5>18. No Joint Venture</h5>
            <p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Voiaxis solely as a result of these Terms or use of our Services.</p>

            <h5>Share only voice recordings and images that are your original work or that you are authorized to share.</h5>
            <p>You retain ownership of the material you upload to Jamme. Ensure that the content you share is genuine and refrain from sharing any material that you&#39;ve obtained from the Internet without proper rights. Familiarize yourself with intellectual property laws to understand your rights and responsibilities.</p>
            <h5>Please share only suitable voice notes, audio content, and photos for an audience of all ages.</h5>
            <p>While we understand the desire to share artistic nudes or unique audio recordings, Jamme&#39;s policies prohibit nudity and explicit content. This includes any imagery or sounds that feature sexual acts, genitalia, and fully exposed buttocks, as well as certain depictions of female nipples, barring exceptions for breastfeeding, childbirth, health situations, or acts of protest. Furthermore, we do not allow profanity or explicit language on Jamme. Sharing pictures or voice notes about children is common, but we prioritize safety and may remove content depicting nude or partly nude children to prevent misuse. Engage in authentic, spam-free interactions. Do not manipulate likes, followers, or shares, post repetitive comments, contact others for commercial purposes without consent, or exchange money for engagement. Misrepresenting user reviews or ratings is also against our guidelines. While anonymity is permitted, we require accurate information from our users. Impersonation or creating accounts to bypass our rules or deceive others is not allowed. Abide by the law. Jamme does not condone the endorsement of war, terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups.
