          <h2>CSAE Policy: Protecting Children on Our Platform</h2>
          <div class="blog__details">
            <h3>Policy Rationale</h3>
            <p>
              At Jamme, safeguarding children is our highest priority. We uphold
              a
              <strong
                >zero-tolerance policy towards Child Sexual Abuse and
                Exploitation (CSAE)</strong
              >
              and are deeply committed to providing a safe, inclusive, and
              secure digital environment. Our policies and practices are
              designed to detect, prevent, and address any form of CSAE content
              or behavior.
            </p>

            <h3>Commitment to Child Safety</h3>
            <p>
              We strictly prohibit any content or actions that exploit or
              endanger children. Any indications of child exploitation are
              promptly reported to the appropriate authorities, including the
              National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) at
              <a href="https://report.cybertip.org/reporting" target="_blank"
                >https://report.cybertip.org/reporting</a
              >, in accordance with applicable laws. We also remove content
              involving children, even when shared with good intentions, to
              mitigate potential misuse and safeguard against harm.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our policies are continually reviewed and enhanced with guidance
              from external experts, including advisory boards on child safety
              and online protection, as well as organizations such as UNICEF,
              WeProtect Global Alliance, and the Internet Watch Foundation
              (IWF).
            </p>

          <h2>Introducing New Age Verification Options on Jamme</h2>
          <div class="blog__details">
            <h3>Reimagining how we verify age</h3>
            <p>
              We’re developing innovative ways to help ensure the right
              experience for every age group on Jamme, starting with users in
              India. If someone tries to update their date of birth from under
              18 to 18 or older, we’ll guide them through a new age verification
              process. Users can now choose options: upload an ID, capture a
              video selfie, or ask mutual friends to vouch for their age.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the near future, we will partner with
              <a href="https://www.yoti.com/" target="_blank">Yoti</a>, a
              trusted leader in online age verification, to prioritize privacy
              and security. Here’s how it works:
            </p>

            <h4>Video Selfie</h4>
            <p>
              Coming Soon - Effortlessly verify your age by uploading a video
              selfie. Follow simple on-screen instructions to capture your
              video. Once complete, we share the image with Yoti, who estimates
              your age based on facial features and shares the result with us.
              Both Jamme and Yoti delete the image after processing. Rest
              assured, the technology identifies your age - not your identity.
            </p>

            <h4>Social Vouching</h4>
            <p>
              Connect with your community to confirm your age. Select three
              mutual followers, all over 18, to vouch for you. These individuals
              will receive a request and have three days to respond. Built-in
              safeguards ensure this process is secure and reliable.
            </p>

            <h4>Upload Your ID</h4>
            <p>
              Easily upload government-issued identification like a driver’s
              license or ID card. This option is secure, and your ID will be
              stored safely on our servers and deleted within 30 days.
            </p>

            <p>
              These new methods are designed with your privacy in mind, keeping
              Jamme a safe and inclusive space for everyone.
