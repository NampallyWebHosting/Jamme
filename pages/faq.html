            <h5>Are voice audio messages end-to-end encrypted ?</h5>
            <p>Users can enable message encryption in their settings. In the app with message encryption turned on, each message is encrypted end-to-end: Both on-device and cloud processing were designed with layers of security to help keep your Jamme experience safe. We have safeguards in place to protect data from being hacked. Data sent to our cloud is encrypted and securely stored in the cloud servers.</p>
            <h5>A brief description of our encryption model follows :</h5>
            <p>End-to-end encryption for audio streams involves accessing the audio frame or packet and encrypting it post-compression before transmission to the Media Server or cloud. Currently, the cloud manages encryption. For storage in the cloud, we utilize SSE-S3 encryption, and for data transmission from the cloud to mobile devices, we employ HTTPS through CloudFront to ensure secure transmission.</p>
            <p>We also follow a hybrid encryption model. Initially, we generate a pair of asynchronous encryption keys on the client-side. The private key is stored within the device's Keychain, while the public key is stored on our servers. For each message that's sent, a unique symmetric AES-128 key (a message key) is generated. This key is used to encrypt the actual content of the message. The generated message key is then encrypted asymmetrically using the private key from the sender's Keychain and the public keys of the other participants. This encrypted message key is attached to the message before it is sent. Upon receiving the message, the recipients can decrypt the message key using their respective private keys that correspond to the public keys used for encryption. Once the message key is decrypted, it can be used to decrypt the actual message content. The encrypted content of the messages is persistently stored on our servers.</p>
            <h5>How is Jamme moderated ?</h5>
            <p>Jamme has a self-moderation policy: users have powerful tools to fully moderate behaviour on their content - tools that normally other platforms reserve for themselves. You don't need to appeal to us as you can remove offending content yourself! You can delete, hide, and block troublemakers. We don't remove people platform-wide for polite disagreement, or over politics, but we do remove people for harassment, impersonation, foul behaviour, and illegal content.</p>
            <h5>What happens when I block someone ?</h5>
            <p>Users can block accounts on the platform they don't like. Blocking a user prevents the user from seeing or interacting with any of your content. When you block a user: The user cannot see any content hosted by you in its entirety. The user is removed from any of your interactions they might have previously been registered. The user cannot see any post or comment posted by you in across the platform.</p>
            <h5>What is the interest-based ads ?</h5>
            <p>Interest-based ads are used to highlight products and services that may be relevant to you based on your interests. For example, if you listen to 'nike shoe' audio advertisement, you may later receive a relevant ad on platform related to footwear.</p>
            <p>We share advertising IDs with third-party skill and content providers that want to deliver ads on Jamme. An advertising ID is a unique string of letters and numbers that does not contain any information that directly identifies you—like your name or email address. It's a privacy-protecting way to help advertisers deliver ads while keeping track of your preferences. Each Jamme user advert interest has unique advertising IDs specific to each skill developer and content provider. This is designed to prevent developers and advertisers from using the advertising IDs to create advertising profiles based on interactions.</p>
            <h5>How do I manage my advertising preferences on Jamme ?</h5>
            <p>You can instruct us not to use the advertising IDs to deliver interest-based audio ads to you. You only need to set this preference once for all third parties because this setting applies to your Jamme account. Manage these preferences or reset your advertising preferences in the Jamme app (Settings > Jamme Privacy > Manage Audio Ad Permissions and Ad Preferences).</p>
