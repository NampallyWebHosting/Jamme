                <p>These Terms of Use and your use of the Application are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of United Kingdom, without regard to its conflict of law principles   If the parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the Central Arbitration Committee (“CAC”) and, where appropriate, the CAC’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“CAC Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the CAC web site https://www.gov.uk/. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the CAC Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the CAC Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable CAC rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in a location that mutually agreed by both parties and United Kingdom law shall apply. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator   'The Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defences of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non convenient with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the United Kingdom courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use. Instead, this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom, without regard to its conflict of law principles.'   This revision ensures that the jurisdiction and governing laws are explicitly stated as being in the United Kingdom, which is essential for legal clarity and enforceability of the terms within the UK legal framework. In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Application be commenced more than 2 years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court   The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.

We have devoted considerable time to contemplating the variety of perspectives that foster a welcoming and inclusive space for all. Our Community Guidelines were crafted to enable you to contribute to nurturing and safeguarding this remarkable community. By engaging with Jamme, you consent to abide by these guidelines as well as our Terms of Service. We stand firmly by these guidelines and encourage you to do the same. Violating these rules may lead to removed content, account deactivation, or other limitations.</p>
                <h5>Disabled Jamme accounts</h5>
                <p>If your Jamme account is inaccessible, you&#39;ll be notified via a message during your login attempt.

Accounts that have been permanently removed by you or someone with access to your password cannot be recovered. You&#39;re free to sign up again using the same email address, although reclaiming your previous username might not be possible. If your account has been compromised or you&#39;re experiencing login difficulties, please visit our account security page through a desktop or mobile browser to regain control of your account.</p>
                <p>Occasionally, we may permit content that typically violates our Community Guidelines when it carries significant news value or is pertinent to the public discourse. Such exceptions are made after carefully balancing the importance to the public against the potential for harm, guided by global human rights benchmarks in making these determinations.</p>
                <h5>Share only voice recordings and images that are your original work or that you are authorized to share.</h5>
                <p>You retain ownership of the material you upload to Jamme.

Familiarize yourself with intellectual property laws to understand your rights and responsibilities.</p>
                <h5>Please share only suitable voice notes, audio content, and photos for an audience of all ages.</h5>
                <p>While we understand the desire to share artistic nudes or unique audio recordings, Jamme&#39;s policies prohibit nudity and explicit content. This includes any imagery or sounds that feature sexual acts, genitalia, and fully exposed buttocks, as well as certain depictions of female nipples, barring exceptions for breastfeeding, childbirth, health situations, or acts of protest.

            <h3>FAQ's</h3>
            <div class="details">
            <p>Effective Date: July 7<sup>th</sup> 2021</p>
            <h5>Are voice audio messages end-to-end encrypted ?</h5>
            <p>Users can enable message encryption in their settings. In the app with message encryption turned on, each message is encrypted end-to-end: Both on-device and cloud processing were designed with layers of security to help keep your Jamme experience safe. We have safeguards in place to protect data from being hacked. Data sent to our cloud is encrypted and securely stored in the cloud servers.</p>
            <h5>A brief description of our encryption model follows :</h5>
            <p>End-to-end encryption for audio streams involves accessing the audio frame or packet and encrypting it post-compression before transmission to the Media Server or cloud. Currently, the cloud manages encryption. For storage in the cloud, we utilize SSE-S3 encryption, and for data transmission from the cloud to mobile devices, we employ HTTPS through CloudFront to ensure secure transmission.</p>
            <p>We also follow a hybrid encryption model. Initially, we generate a pair of asynchronous encryption keys on the client-side. The private key is stored within the device's Keychain, while the public key is stored on our servers. For each message that's sent, a unique symmetric AES-128 key (a message key) is generated. This key is used to encrypt the actual content of the message. The generated message key is then encrypted asymmetrically using the private key from the sender's Keychain and the public keys of the other participants. This encrypted message key is attached to the message before it is sent. Upon receiving the message, the recipients can decrypt the message key using their respective private keys that correspond to the public keys used for encryption. Once the message key is decrypted, it can be used to decrypt the actual message content. The encrypted content of the messages is persistently stored on our servers.</p>
            <h5>How is Jamme moderated ?</h5>
            <p>Jamme has a self-moderation policy: users have powerful tools to fully moderate behaviour on their content - tools that normally other platforms reserve for themselves. You don't need to appeal to us as you can remove offending content yourself! You can delete, hide, and block troublemakers. We don't remove people platform-wide for polite disagreement, or over politics, but we do remove people for harassment, impersonation, foul behaviour, and illegal content.</p>
            <h5>What happens when I block someone ?</h5>
            <p>Users can block accounts on the platform they don't like. Blocking a user prevents the user from seeing or interacting with any of your content. When you block a user: The user cannot see any content hosted by you in its entirety. The user is removed from any of your interactions they might have previously been registered. The user cannot see any post or comment posted by you in across the platform.</p>
            <h5>What is the interest-based ads ?</h5>
            <p>Interest-based ads are used to highlight products and services that may be relevant to you based on your interests. For example, if you listen to 'nike shoe' audio advertisement, you may later receive a relevant ad on platform related to footwear.</p>
            <p>We share advertising IDs with third-party skill and content providers that want to deliver ads on Jamme. An advertising ID is a unique string of letters and numbers that does not contain any information that directly identifies you—like your name or email address. It's a privacy-protecting way to help advertisers deliver ads while keeping track of your preferences. Each Jamme user advert interest has unique advertising IDs specific to each skill developer and content provider. This is designed to prevent developers and advertisers from using the advertising IDs to create advertising profiles based on interactions.</p>
            <h5>How do I manage my advertising preferences on Jamme ?</h5>
            <p>You can instruct us not to use the advertising IDs to deliver interest-based audio ads to you. You only need to set this preference once for all third parties because this setting applies to your Jamme account. Manage these preferences or reset your advertising preferences in the Jamme app (Settings > Jamme Privacy > Manage Audio Ad Permissions and Ad Preferences).</p>
            <h5>Why Jamme asks for certain info to create an account ?</h5>
            <p>When you create a Jamme Account, we ask for some personal information. This info helps keep your account secure and makes our services more useful. To learn more about how we use this info, read the Jamme Privacy Policy. What we ask for and why</p>
